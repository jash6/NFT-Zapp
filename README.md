# NFT-Zapp.

The NFT ZAP marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to buy, sell, swap, burn, and stake NFTs. The platform provides a secure and user-friendly interface for NFT collectors and creators to interact with one another.

### Abstract

###### Problem:
It is not easy to swap NFTs as it requires a sense of trust between NFT holders to execute the exchange securely. The majority of individuals in the crypto space prefer to remain anonymous. Over the years, from 2020 to 2023, NFT holders have lost over 630 Million dollars during the exchange and transfer process, which is a concerning issue for the NFT community.

###### Solution:
The NFT ZAP marketplace is a decentralized platform that enables users to buy, sell, swap, burn, and stake NFTs. It offers a secure and user-friendly interface for NFT collectors and creators to interact with each other. The project team followed a software development process that included gathering requirements, designing architecture, development and testing, deployment and infrastructure, quality assurance and security, and user acceptance testing. The platform's main features include a Vault-like system for NFT swapping, partnerships with NFT creators and sellers, and a comprehensive marketing and promotion strategy to attract users. The project has the potential to disrupt the traditional art and collectibles market and presents a considerable opportunity for investors and collectors.
